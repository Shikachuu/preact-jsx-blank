# ![logo](template/assets/favicon.ico) Blank-[Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) with JSX

This is a template for [preact-cli](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli).

I don't like using only `.js` for file extension for (p)react things so I choose `.jsx`.

Also clean up all the place holders to a one liner and deleted CSS things because I don't like to start a project with cleaning up.

Router and React compatibility is already done for you.

# Usage

``` bash
$ npm install -g preact-cli
$ preact create Shikachuu/preact-jsx-blank my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
# Commands

- `npm run start`: Runs `serve` or `dev`, depending on `NODE_ENV` value. Defaults to `dev server`

- `npm run dev`: Run a development, HMR server

- `npm run serve`: Run a production-like server

- `npm run build`: Production-ready build
